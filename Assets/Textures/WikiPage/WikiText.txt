Crested pigeon
==============
A common gray pigeon that is easily identified by the long pointed crest on the top of its head. Mostly pale gray with bright iridescence on wings. Feeds only on the ground. Takes flight with noisy wing-claps, and in flight has a wing-whistle which makes it sound like a wind-up toy. Common in open habitats and is often present in suburban areas.

Yellow crested cockatoo
=======================
A medium-sized white cockatoo with a yellow crest; rare and endangered throughout its native range but has several strong naturalized populations across Asia. Raucous and social, usually seen in large flocks flying noisily over forested areas. Noticeably smaller than the similarly-colored Sulphur-crested Cockatoo; no natural range overlap, but the two coexist in parts of their introduced range, such as Singapore.

Superb lyrebird
===============
Large ground-dwelling bird with powerful legs and long tail. Primarily gray-brown with reddish outer wing. Males have spectacular long tail comprising different feather types. The main “lyre” feathers bold barring while the other feathers are plain, thin, and wispy. Juveniles and females lack the longer tail feathers. This may cause confusion with Albert’s Lyrebird, but note range and color of underparts (cold and grayish in Superb). Superb Lyrebird is found in rainforest habitats in southeastern Australia, where it forages in leaf litter for food. It has a very powerful song and is known for mimicking other species.

Red Wattlebird
==============
Large, gray-brown, streaked honeyeater with small pink flaps of facial skin (wattles) and a bright yellow lower belly. Adult has black crown, red eye with white patch below, yellow belly, and streaking across neck, back, and breast. Juvenile is more uniformly brown, with less defined facial wattles. This species is found in a wide variety of habitats across southern mainland Australia. It can be quite aggressive and typically chases smaller species away from flowering trees. Has a wide variety of loud, harsh vocalizations, many of which are familiar noises across southern Australia.

Laughing Kookaburra
===================
Common, very large kingfisher with a dark eye and brown cheek patch. In Queensland take care to identify from Blue-winged Kookaburra, which has a pale eye and a pale streaked head. Typical calls include an immediately recognizable and distinctive laugh, which gives the species its common name. Abundant in parks, towns, forests, and campgrounds.

Eastern Rosella
===============
Blue and yellow rosella with a bright red head/chest and white cheeks. May hybridize with Pale-headed Rosella in areas where the distribution overlaps in far north New South Wales and southeastern Queensland (hybrids typically show some red on the head, but with more blue on the chest; they look a bit washed out). Occurs in open forests and woodlands and may also be found in parks and gardens. Normal range is south eastern Australia and Tasmania. Introduced populations occur in New Zealand.

Australian Magpie
=================
Large black-and-white bird with long, pale bill with dark tip. Larger than butcherbirds and differently patterned. Black head, face, underparts, white nape, upperwing coverts, and rump, and either black or white back (subspecies vary in plumage). Widespread in farmland, parks, and open woodlands, where usually seen in pairs or groups strutting on the ground. Song a memorable fluty warble.

Common Myna
===========
A large, black-and-brown myna with white wing patches, yellow bill, and yellow legs. Gregarious and often found in noisy flocks. Aggressive, often driving away other birds. Can be found just about anywhere but the densest forests. Native to southern Asia, where it is among the most common species. Widely introduced elsewhere in the world, including Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii.

Australian Ibis
===============
Common white and black ibis. Adult has bare black head, while juvenile has feathered head. Originally associated with wetlands and marshes (fresh and salt), it is now often seen in urban areas and has developed a reputation as the "Bin Chicken" due to its habit of scavenging food.
